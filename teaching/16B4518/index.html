    <h2>Course Information</h2>
        <p><b>CS 4518: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing</b><br>
        <b>Term:</b> B Term, 2016<br>
        <b>Time:</b> 8:00am to 9:50am<br>
        <b>Days:</b> Tuesdays and Fridays<br>
        <b>Location:</b> Fuller Labs 320</p>

<h3>Course Catalog Description</h3>

    <p>
        This course introduces students to modern mobile computing in the era of cloud computing. As one of the most ubiquitously used devices, mobile phones have revolutionized the way we think about computing. With the help of cloud services, mobile devices are exhibiting unlimited potentials in terms of the types of tasks they can achieve, e.g. speech recognition. To help students develop both hands-on mobile programming and mobile solution design principles, this course is split into two coherent parts.
        <br><br>
        The first half of the course is designed to introduce the basic of mobile applications development for Android-based devices, with a specific focus on the essential concepts of software deployments for mobile and battery-constrained devices. Topics to be expected include UI programming, data management, localization, and programming sensors. The second half of the course introduces the concept of cloud computing, and provides students the opportunities to use a number of Google cloud services. Topics to be expected include performance optimization and mobile backend design.
        <br><br>
        The evaluation of the course will include thirteen in-class quizzes, four individual Android programming projects, and a team-based (with up to 3 persons) term project. Proficiency in an Object Oriented Language such as Java or C# is strongly recommended.  Knowledge of operating systems (CS3013 or equivalent) and computer networks (CS3516 or
        equivalent) are important in understanding mobile design trade-offs. Familiarity with Linux or Unix is essential. Students who have credit
        for CS 528 may not earn subsequent credit for this
        course.

<h2>Course Policies and Procedures</h2>
  
<p>The following represent the official policies and procedures for
  the course. Please review this information and, if you have
  questions, discuss them with the professor as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Official Communication</h3> 

<p>Class discussion, class hand-outs, emails to the student's WPI 
   email account, the <a href="https://ia.wpi.edu/cs4518/forum.php">class discussion board</a>, and the course Web pages are avenues for official
   course communication. Students are responsible for any information 
   posted through these venues.</p>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

    For required textbooks, you can choose to get either one of the following.
    <ul>
        <li><i>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch (Second edition)</i>, Bill Phillips and Brian Hardy, The Big Nerd Ranch, 2015</li>
        <li><i>Head First Android Development</i>, Dawn Griffiths and David Griffiths, O'Reilly Books, 2015.</li>
    </ul>

<p> In this course, we will be reading selected chapters from required textbooks and supplement materials
    provided by the instructor. Although there are a lot of free online resources for learning Android,
    the rationale of a textbook is to provide the student a systematic
    road map in learning. Students
    will be responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided
    by the instructor and, if needed, printing it out for reading.
</p>


    <h3>Course Grading</h3>

    <p>In this course, we will be using absolute grading for assigning final grades:
        all numerical grades of 90 and higher earn As, all grades from 78 to 89.9 earn Bs,
        and all grades from 65 to 77.9 earn Cs. No incomplete grades will be assigned unless
        there exist exceptional, extenuating circumstances.
        A description of each of the class components and their corresponding weights are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Quizzes (30%):</b>  There will be thirteen quizzes, each 10-15 minutes long,
            at the beginning of each class (except for the first class). Quizzes are available
            in two forms: through InstructAssist (IA) or printed version.
            I strongly encourage you to take quizzes through IA.
            The two lowest quiz scores will automatically be dropped,
            allowing for absences, illnesses, or simply "bad days". The quizzes will be short (1 printed page).
            The first set of questions will cover material from reading due <b>before</b> class
            and will be more factual (and simplistic) in nature. The final question will be more design or
            application-oriented, requiring students to apply concepts from prior class discussions
            to new challenges.<br>&nbsp;</li>

        <li><b>Individual Projects (35%)</b>: There will be multiple individual projects in the course
            where students will complete Android-based programming with increasing complexities.
            These individual projects may have different point values and may have "checkpoint" deliverables
            in which students can earn partial points. Details for each project can be found through
            <a href="https://ia.wpi.edu/cs4518/real_files.php?page=projects">here</a>.
            <br>&nbsp;</li>

        <li><b>Term Project (35%):</b> There will be one term-long project that students may pursue
            in teams of up to <b>four</b> people. The instructor has provided several potential project ideas that
            students may choose from. Students are encouraged to propose their own projects. The detail of
            this term-based project is described <a>here</a>.</li> <br>

        <li><b>Participation and Professionalism (5%):</b> Students are expected to be engaged in class,
        answering questions from the instructor and asking questions when needed.
        Students must regularly attend classes and show up to demonstration times they schedule.
        This grading component is a signed value that provides bonus scores for students who promote active learning environment.
        Students that simply attend class each day and participate adequately should expect to earn around an 85% in participation.
        Voluntary participation in discussion or the discussion board, via questions or comments, is required to earn full credit in this category.<br>&nbsp;</li>

    </ul>


<h3>InstructAssist</h3>

<p>This course will use the InstructAssist system which has been
developed for interactive instruction. This system features in-class
components, including Quiz Bowls and Activities, as well as
out-of-class components, such as assignment submission and grading
feedback.</p>

<p>You can access the InstructAssist system for this class at <a
href="https://ia.wpi.edu/cs4518/">https://ia.wpi.edu/cs4518/</a>. You
will be required to log in through WPI's Central Authentication
Service with your WPI credentials to access the system.</p>


<h3>Course Participation and Professionalism</h3>

<p>During lectures, students are to be focused on the course. Students
should not use materials or electronic devices that would inhibit
their attention to the course lecture and discussion. Laptops
may only be used for note-taking purposes; transmission capabilities
on these devices must be disabled and only appropriate note-taking
applications may be used in class.</p>

<p>Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect
at all times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are
healthy aspects of academic environments; however, students be careful
to avoid demeaning language or comments which can be taken
personally. The ability to handle conflict professionally and work
with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.</p>

<h3>Course Projects</h3>
    <p>In this course, students are expected to complete four individual Android Programming projects and a team-based term project with a group of up to 3 people. </p>

    <p>Each individual project will have a series of objectives that must be met by students in order to earn credit. Instructions and project grading policy will be provided at the time when projects are assigned.  Students may discuss high-level ideas and provide advice to each other to help each other. However, all submitted work must be the result of the student's own efforts and should not include files or systems used by other students. If students have questions about the appropriate about of collaboration, they should contact their instructor. Each individual project may have a different score weight associated with it. Students should not assume that all individual projects are of equal weight.
    </p>

    <p>
        The term-long project is divided into multiple phases and each phase require a submission per team. The project is designed to help students design, implement, and evaluate a mobile-based application of their choices. The instructor has also provided a few potential application ideas for students to choose from.
        Submissions are graded for each phase separately and all team members are assigned points based on indicated contributions. Accordingly, students should be advised that the implementation will be a relatively small portion of the term project.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Google Cloud Credits:</b> In this course, we will experiment with using public cloud services for course projects. The instructor has obtained supports from Google Education Grant that provides free cloud credits for all students in this course. We will be using Google Clouds for at least one individual project, and
            the credits are more than enough for completing the project. Optionally students
            can choose to use the remaining credits for their term projects. If so, please pay special attention to your cloud bills and plan carefully about how you want to allocate your credits. Note, most cloud resources are charged based on usages. If you are not using the resources, please remember to follow the guidelines to release unused resources to avoid unnecessary charges.
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Version Control:</b> Using version control such as Git is a good idea, especially for
            team-based project. However, please do NOT put your code in a public repository,
            such as a default free GitHub repository, as this will make it too tempting for
            other students in the course (now or later) to violate the academic
            honesty rules. Both GitHub and BitBucket offer free unlimited PRIVATE
            Git repositories for students.

            In addition, I have obtained supports from GitHub for
            an organization plan with unlimited free private repositories and unlimited seats.
            If you would like to use GitHub for your team-based project,
            please post a request through IA forum with your GitHub handler. And I will
            create a private repository for your team.</li>
        </ul>
